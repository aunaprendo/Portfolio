			<h2>The Lost Nut: A Cautionary Tail</h2>
			<p class="author">By: Hazel Nibblesnout</p>
			<p>I’ll admit it: I’ve lost it. My nut. The nut. The perfect, glossy acorn I spent three days selecting, polishing, and finally burying in what I was certain was the most secure patch of soil in the entire forest. I remember the moment vividly—the satisfying thud of earth covering treasure, the proud twitch of my tail as I marked the spot. But now, only days later, I stand in a clearing that looks… exactly like every other clearing.<br />
				At first, I tried to stay calm. “It’s fine, Hazel,” I told myself. “You’re a professional. You wrote the column on efficient caching!” But after the sixth identical mound of leaves and the third judgmental glance from a blue jay, I began to spiral. I’ve sniffed every root, pawed through every patch of dirt, and interrogated two moles (neither helpful).<br />
				They say memory loss is part of the squirrel experience—that we plant forests through our forgetfulness. Romantic, isn’t it? But when you’re shivering under a half-empty oak, “ecological contribution” doesn’t feel quite as comforting.<br />
			Still, I suppose there’s a moral here: maybe some nuts are meant to be lost, to grow into something greater than our winter stash. Or maybe I’m just trying to make peace with the fact that I’ll be dining on bark soup until spring. Either way, dear readers, mark your caches better than I did. Your future self will thank you.</p>

			<h3>Moving On: Drey on the Market</h3>
			<p class="author">By: Chestnut Whiskertail</p>
			<p>After three glorious seasons of cozying up in this oak-top drey, I’ve decided it’s time to move on. Before rumors spread among the branches, let me be the first to tell you: yes, I’m selling my nest. It’s not an easy decision—this place has seen me through storms, leaf-falls, and one unfortunate run-in with a rather nosy woodpecker—but change is part of every squirrel’s journey.<br />
				The drey itself is in excellent condition. Prime location, high enough to avoid most predators but low enough for a dramatic leap to the neighboring maple. Spacious enough for two squirrels and their acorn stash (or three, if you’re the cuddly type). The insulation—crafted from premium moss and hand-picked twigs—is still remarkably soft, with just a hint of pine-scented nostalgia.<br />
				So why sell? Well, ever since the oak next door sprouted that new branch with a perfect view of the sunrise, I’ve been dreaming of a fresh start. Somewhere quieter, perhaps closer to the stream. Maybe even a multi-drey property—who knows?<br />
				Serious inquiries only, please. No chipmunks. Payment accepted in acorns, hickory nuts, or equivalent barter.<br />
			Until then, I’ll be here, perched on my branch, reminiscing about the seasons past—and planning where to build the next chapter of my squirrel-sized empire.</p>

			<h3>My Human: The Nut Distributor of Dreams</h3>
			<p class="author">By: Pip Whistlefur</p>
			<p>Dear readers, gather your tails and listen well—for I, Pip Whistlefur, have made a discovery that may redefine squirrel civilization as we know it. I have found… a human. Not just any human, mind you, but one who gives me nuts. Freely. Consistently. Without the faintest expectation of barter, bribe, or twig-based tax.<br />
				It began innocently enough—a curious rustle near the park bench, a cautious glance from behind a shrub. The human sat there, munching on something that smelled like paradise roasted in sunlight. Then, in an act of unimaginable generosity, they extended a hand and dropped a peanut—unshelled!—upon the ground. I hesitated, of course (I’ve seen what seagulls do when trust goes wrong), but hunger and curiosity won out. One nibble later, I was converted.<br />
				Now, each morning, I meet my human benefactor. They arrive with their steaming cup of leaf-water (they call it “coffee,” I believe) and a small paper bag full of treasures. Sometimes almonds, sometimes hazelnuts, once—oh glorious day—a cashew. We’ve developed a rhythm: they talk, I chatter, they laugh, I twitch approvingly. It’s a relationship built on mutual fascination and snacks.<br />
				I know some of you will call it risky, even undignified. But I say this: perhaps friendship doesn’t always come from our own kind. Sometimes it comes from a creature with strange paws and a kind heart, who looks at a scruffy squirrel and thinks, you deserve a nut today.<br />
			And really, who am I to argue with that kind of wisdom?</p>

			<h3>The Art of Mushroom Jerky: A Forager’s Gourmet Guide</h3>
			<p class="author">Juniper Quickpaws</p>
			<p>As the crisp scent of autumn drifts through the canopy and the acorns grow scarce, a squirrel must think beyond the nut. While some of my peers spend their days frantically burying oak offerings, I’ve been dabbling in the finer things—namely, mushroom jerky. Yes, you read that correctly. Dehydrated fungi, seasoned by nature herself, and perfected by paws both nimble and determined.<br />
				It all began when I stumbled upon a patch of plump chanterelles after a rainstorm. Their golden caps glowed like buried treasure, and a thought struck me: why should humans have all the culinary creativity? With a bit of experimentation (and one unfortunate incident involving a questionable toadstool), I developed a process any discerning squirrel chef can follow.<br />
				Step one: Selection. Choose only the finest, non-poisonous mushrooms. If you’re unsure, consult an experienced hedgehog—they always know.<br />
				Step two: Preparation. Slice the caps thinly using your incisors (carefully—presentation matters).<br />
				Step three: Seasoning. A touch of pine resin for chew, a dusting of crushed acorn for flavor, and, if you’re feeling fancy, a hint of dew for shine.<br />
				Step four: Drying. Spread your slices across a sunny rock and guard them from curious blue jays. In two days, you’ll have chewy, savory morsels that keep for weeks—perfect for long winter nights or impressing a potential mate.<br />
				Mushroom jerky may not replace the humble nut, but it’s a bold reminder that we squirrels are more than mere gatherers—we’re innovators, gourmands, artists of the canopy kitchen.<br />
			Bon appétit, my furry friends. And remember: if it glows, don’t eat it.</p>

			<h2>Nuts About You: A Squirrel’s Guide to Unexpected Love</h2>
			<p class="author">Clover Softtail</p>
			<p>I wasn’t looking for love. Honestly, who has time? Between gathering acorns, dodging hawks, and maintaining a respectable drey, romance seemed like something for poets and pigeons. But fate—sneaky, fluttery thing that it is—had other plans.<br />
				It started on an ordinary morning. I was mid-leap between branches, cheeks full of breakfast, when I spotted him. There he was—sleek fur, glossy tail, the kind of confident leap that says, “I’ve never missed a branch in my life.” He dropped an acorn. I, ever graceful, tripped over my own. Our eyes met in mutual embarrassment, and just like that, the world shrank to the space between two twigs.<br />
				Since that day, we’ve been inseparable—or as inseparable as two fiercely independent squirrels can be. We race along branches, stash our nuts side by side, and share stolen sips from the same puddle after rain. He claims I chatter too much; I claim he over-fluffs his tail. Somehow, it works.<br />
				Love, I’ve learned, isn’t the grand swoop of a hawk or the thunder of falling acorns. It’s in the small things—the shared warmth in winter, the quiet rustle of leaves when you’re both too full of nuts to move, the way your heart races when you spot a flash of familiar fur among the trees.<br />
			So to my readers who think love is a distraction from survival—perhaps it is. But oh, what a glorious, heart-thumping distraction it can be. And if you find someone who makes your whiskers tingle and your paws fumble your prized acorn… hold onto them tighter than your winter stash.</p>
