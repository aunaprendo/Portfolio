 <h2 class="post-title">Squirrel Life</h2>
 <p class="post-excerpt">Being a squirrel means constantly being on the 
move, darting through trees and foraging for food to stash away for the winter. 
Life is a mix of instinct, agility, and keen awareness of predators and changing 
seasons. Every day is a survival mission wrapped in bursts of curiosity and play.
