      <section> <h2>Cute Squirrels</h2>
        <p>Cute squirrels are tiny, bushy-tailed bundles of energy that charm people with their playful antics and curious expressions. With bright eyes, twitchy noses, and fluffy tails that puff up like pom-poms, they scurry around trees and parks, often pausing to nibble on a nut with their tiny paws. Whether they’re leaping through the air, peeking out from behind branches, or stuffing their cheeks with food, squirrels radiate a mix of mischief and sweetness that makes them irresistibly endearing to watch.</p>

      <section> <h2>Baby Squirrels</h2>
        <p>Baby squirrels, also known as kits or pups, are born tiny, hairless, and blind, completely dependent on their mother for warmth and care. As they grow, they quickly develop soft fur, open their eyes around four weeks old, and begin to explore the nest. By six to eight weeks, they start climbing and nibbling on solid food, showing early signs of the agility and curiosity squirrels are known for. With their oversized heads, delicate paws, and wobbly movements, baby squirrels are especially adorable and fascinating to observe as they learn about the world.</p>
