 <p>Squirrels are expert hoarders, but what many don't know is they 
deliberately fake burying food to throw off potential thieves. When they feel 
watched, squirrels will dig a hole, pretend to drop a nut in, and cover it,
leaving the real stash hidden elsewhere. This clever deception helps protect their 
winter supply from birds and other squirrels. They rely heavily on memory and 
spatial awareness to find their real caches later. However, many of these hidden 
nuts are never retrieved, inadvertently planting new trees.<span class="blurred">

 <p>Squirrels can talk to each other using a secret language of tail 
flicks and vocalizations. They emit high-pitched warning calls that vary depending 
on the type of predator nearby whether it is a hawk above or a cat below. Their 
bushy tails also serve as visual signals, communicating mood or alertness. Some 
scientists believe squirrels even eavesdrop on birds and other animals to assess 
environmental dangers. This secret communication network helps them survive in both 
wild and urban areas.<span class="blurred"><em>SQUIRREL SECRETS</em></span></p>

 <p>One surprising secret is that squirrels have excellent problem-solving 
skills and long-term memories. They can remember complex routes through mazes and 
learn how to bypass human obstacles to reach bird feeders. In fact, some species 
even recognize individual human faces and remember whether those people are threats 
or not. They've also been known to cooperate in stealing food, especially in 
parks where humans often feed them. Behind their playful exterior is a brain 
hardwired for survival, stealth, and strategy.<span class="blurred">
