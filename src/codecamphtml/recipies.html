      <li> 1 tbsp nut butter (e.g., almond or sunflower seed butter) </li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>In a mixing bowl, combine:</em> Crushed acorns (make sure they’ve been properly leached to remove tannins!) - Chopped hazelnuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds - Rolled oats (if using) - Finely chopped dried apple and cranberries/raisins</li>
      <li> <em>Stir in:</em> Nut butter and tree sap syrup. Mix until the ingredients are sticky and clump together. Add a bit more nut butter or syrup if it feels too dry. </li>
      <li> <em>Shape Treats:</em> Take small scoops (about 1 tablespoon) and roll into tight little balls or press into bite-sized discs. </li>
      <li> <em>On a plate, mix:</em> Ground pine nuts and toasted bark flakes or finely crumbled cinnamon bark (optional for aroma and aesthetics). Then roll each treat gently in the coating until evenly covered. </li>
      <li><em>Let Set:</em> Place treats on a parchment-lined tray and refrigerate for 30–60 minutes to firm up. (If for squirrels, you can skip this step—just store them in a cool place.)  </li>
    </ol>
